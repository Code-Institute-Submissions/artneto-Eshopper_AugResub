## **Design Choices**

### **Typography**

- The navigation bar, page titles, and buttons are all in the "'Open Sans'" font family. This design has a very become and neutral, yet friendly appearance, and even though the website is dedicated to health and fitness, it just seemed appropriate to employ.
- And for Logo I decided to apply 'Roboto' to allows letters to take up the space needed to give power aspect to logo. 


### **Colour Scheme**

The colors used in this project are:
- (#BB390F) - Rust
- (#EAE7EA )- Platinum
- (#D8B34E) - Metallic gold
  - The combination of these colors gave a very attractive look to the site. I decided go for rust for the buttons because stand out and packs an energetic punch.

-   ### Wireframes

Users can search for a specific product by name or by keyword using the search box at the top of the page.
A search box at the top of the screen allows you to filter products by category, and a dropdown selector on the right of the screen allows you to sort by price, classification as A-Z products, or low-to-high pricing.

#### Add/remove products to/from cart and update quantity
- On the product detail page, unregistered users can add items to their shopping cart.
Once logged in, customers can add items from the detailed product page to their bag and choose how many of that particular item to add to their cart. The user must click on the cart information to be taken to the cart page, where there will be action buttons to remove items from the cart and entries to change the quantity.

#### Payment, save information and confirmation email 
  - Users with and without accounts can buy products. When the user is ready to proceed with the  payment and is on the cart page, they can click the "checkout" button to be taken to the payment page, that they can fill out the required fields that really are missing (users can choose to store the information), and then complete their order. Users are routed to a success page where order information is available after the order has indeed been completed. When an order is completed, users are automatically sent a confirmation email including the order details.



#### Profiles 
  - The user can modify the delivery details under the profile page management.

### Features Left to Implement

- Integrate OAuth app to add Google login for quick user registration and login.
- A star rating or upvote feature for the products.
- Implement a space where users can discuss diet or training tips with other users.

### Responsive Design

- The application has been developed for mobile devices but it has been adjusted to provide such a wonderful experience for desktop and tablet users too though.

### Defensive Design

 - Form Validation

    - All forms also have form validation to help ensure the required information is entered        before    submission.
    If incorrect data is entered, a warning message will be displayed to advise the user on how to proceed.

    - A default image will be added if a product is added without an associated image, however form â€™ll work this unlikely.

 - Unauthorised Attempts

    - If a user attempts to access a section of the website for that they're not permitted, they will receive an error 404 message when the page is loaded.

 - @login_required

   -  Addition of the login required decorator to prohibit access to specific pages. Only users     who've been granted approval can add, edit, delete, and edit products.
    A user whom have logged out would be sent to the login page if they attempt to access a restricted page.

 - Review

    - Only users who have received approval can leave a review about the available product. The comment box will be available on the products details page.

  - Bag 

   - Validation has been put in place to ensure sure that it only 99 items at the most can be put there in bag.
    If 0 is selected, the item is taken out of the bag.
    The user will have access to the necessary information, such as the front addition for purchases under 50 euros.
